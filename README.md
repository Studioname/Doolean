# Doolean
I found myself wanting more out of booleans so I implemented truth trees as a datatype. The tree takes two booleans. If the first is true it will return it, otherwise it will return the second value. I want to make it possible to pass a Doolean [dual boolean] to a Doolean, which would allow the user to create full truth trees.
